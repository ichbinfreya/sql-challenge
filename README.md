# sql-challenge
This challenge is about using SQL database as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). 
The first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. 

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis.
## Data Modelling
I sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using QuickDBD. 

## Data Engineering
I created a table schema for each of the six CSV files. I specified the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, There are composite keys in both dept_emp and dept_manager, which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

## Data Analysis
Following by each questions listed in each step. Please refer to my SQL.
