# sql-challenge
This challenge is about using SQL database as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). 
The first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. 

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis.
## Data Modelling
I sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using QuickDBD. 

## Data Engineering
I exported the ERD as a SQL and imported into the Schemas in a SQL database. In the Table section, it automatically created 6 tables correspomding to the six CSV files. Then, I imported each CSV file into each table.

## Data Analysis
Following by each questions.
